# contributing to music-os-core

## purpose

music-os is building a decentralized (meta) data layer for web3 and music. We
want to enable artists to create new ownership, distribution and collaboration
experiences. Albeit potentially built upon similar technological foundations,
in positive terms, to reappropriate the term, music-os shall be web3's "napster
moment."

## design presets

Non-exhaustive list:

- music-os comes with batteries included. No need to install Postgres, Redis or
  any miscellaneous software.
- For all interfaces, music-os implements [semver](https://semver.org/).
