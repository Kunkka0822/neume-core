## installation

### prerequsites

neume-network-core is dependent on an Ethereum full node JSON-RPC interface.
Consider running your own node or choose an existing service from
[ethereumnodes.com](https://ethereumnodes.com/).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:neume-network/core.git

# Copy the example .env file
# ⚠️ Be sure to update the variables in `.env` with the appropriate values!
cp .env-copy .env

# Install the dependencies
npm i

# Run the service
npm run dev
```

## component contract

@neume-network/core guarantees the existence of variables and folders to other
@neume-network packages like @neume-network/strategies. Below, we outline what
core is currently guaranteeing:

### existence and definition of environment variables

@neume-network/core must guarantee the existence and definition of the
following environment variables:

```
RPC_HTTP_HOST=https://
DATA_DIR=data
EXTRACTION_WORKER_CONCURRENCY=12
IPFS_HTTPS_GATEWAY=https://
```

- If `RPC_HTTP_HOST` requires Bearer-token authorization, users must define
  `RPC_API_KEY` to be used in an HTTP `Authorization: Bearer ${RPC_API_KEY}`
  header.
- If `IPFS_HTTPS_GATEWAY` requires Bearer-token authorization, users must
  define `IPFS_HTTPS_GATEWAY_KEY` to be used in an HTTP `Authorization: Bearer ${IPFS_HTTPS_GATEWAY_KEY}` header.

### managing `DATA_DIR` and the file system directory

A directory containing the outputs of all @neume-network/strategies is called
the `DATA_DIR`. Apart from guaranteeing the environment variable's existence,
@neume-network/core must guarantee the directory's existence on the user's file
system.
